### 🔍 About Me

I'm a passionate QA Engineer currently diving deep into **mobile automation** with **Java + Appium**, building robust frameworks for real-time ride-booking applications. I enjoy solving tricky test cases, validating multi-modal journeys (bus 🚍, metro 🚇, suburban 🛤️), and writing clean, maintainable automation code.

- 🔧 Currently building: `ride-booking-automation` – a hybrid automation framework using **Maven**, **Allure Reports**, and **Page Object Model (POM)**.
- 🐍 Also writing automation utility scripts in **Python** to compare OTP, GMap, and survey journey data.
- 💻 Platform: **macOS (M1)** | Tools: **tmux**, **gh CLI**, **Git**, **VS Code**, **Terminal**
- 📱 Testing Platforms: Real Android Devices (via USB Debugging)
